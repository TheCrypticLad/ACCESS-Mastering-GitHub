# ACCESS-Mastering-GitHub
This is going to be Ibitomi Shammah's Assignment Stats for the 8 Weeks of ACCESS 6.0 SAP.

**Week 1 SESSION 1**
We discussed about the basics of GitHub and Features of GitHub; Git Commit, Git Bash, Git Ignore, Git Branch, Git Pull, Git Push e.t.c.
My First Commit - It didn't really go out well , i ran into an error during the demo txt part and i guess because of that i wasnt able to push my commit well to my repo in github

**My Second Commit** this is just for practice, but for this i am making the use of VS Code so i hope it goes well.

**My Third Commit** I went back to GitHub to update this on, this is just for a second practice, to try the Git Pull command
